# Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life in CoffeeScript

Very much a work in progress

You can find a text demo running [here](http://michiel.github.com/gameoflife-coffee),
a canvas board running [here](http://michiel.github.com/gameoflife-coffee/index-canvas.html) and a 
RaphaelJS board [here](http://michiel.github.com/gameoflife-coffee/index-raphael.html)

Use yeoman / grunt to build

 * $ yeoman server
 * $ yeoman build
 * $ yeoman test
